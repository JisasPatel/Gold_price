I have deployed this app through FASTapi on my local machine, to run this app on you local machine download required libraries,
like : fastapi, uvicorn, pickle5, pydantic, scikit-learn, requests, pypi-json, pyngrok, nest-asyncio.
then in your terminal go to the folder where you have all these files, the run this code :- uvicorn model_api:app
app will start running on your local host, now you can run the api_impliment.py file and use the application.
